60 Seconds is a game that already exists, if you haven't heard of it, it is a story based survival game 
where you live in a bomb shelter and try to survive after a nucelar bomb explosion with your family getting 
any one of multiple endings. This is a very fun and simple game and I was wanting to do my own spin on it. 
Introducing the Island edition. Start on a cruise ship trying to scavenge items and family members before the
boat sinks. Then try your best to live on a deserted island waiting for help to arrive or maybe the island holds
on told secrets.
