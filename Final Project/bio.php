<h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I'm Nathan Merrill III. I was Born in 2002 and have been around Games all the time
        mostly due to being the youngest in the family aongside my twin. Persoanlly I've always wanted
        to share my ideas with the world and what better way yo tell stories than through playable games.
    </p>
<h2>Why is there a Website</h2>
    <p>The biggest reason is to just got my ideas out there and motivate me to start accomplishing 
        goals and getting these ideas fleshed out. Especially thoes main 5 plus Best Game. They sure are 
        a far ways away but getting my ideas out there will hopefully get the ball rolling
    </p>
<h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>With some of these Ideas being big and small. I find it best to try to evolve my story telling
        and developer skills by starting out with smaller ideas and tackling bigger ones down the line. 
        Definilty waning to start with one of the side projects first o enhance devolping skills then
        move onto Eternal Winter of Tephra which is a book hat'll focus on stroytelling and good writing.
