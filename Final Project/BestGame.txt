Best Game isn't explanatory at all but still holds a very daunting name and rightfully so. Any 3d Open Wolrd Game is
difficult to make especically if you are wanting to add many mechnics to create a new world anyone would want to
dedicate their time to. Thw Whole idea for this game is a fantasy world where you are able to use magic to collect
and enlist there help on your journey or back at your estate tending to crops, mining, gathering wood or other chores.
At your Estate you can customize freely the outside and inside adding more fun to your gardens for your creatures or 
creating a cozy inside to enjoy the calming atmosphere. You have the ability to capture creatures in your grimorie but 
your immediate party will turn into tattoos on your body essentially turningthem into ink and back again with your magic.
Don't cut yourself to short tough you will be able to fight alongside your creatures in battle. As an open world you are 
free to explore to our content and there will be certain puzzles throughout requiring different kinds of beasts, so go
out there and mkae some new friends and allies.
