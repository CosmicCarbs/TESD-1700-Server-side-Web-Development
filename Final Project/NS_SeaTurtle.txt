Natural Selection: Sea Turtle is the first in a series where you try your best to survive as a Sea Turtle. With the harsh
beginning as the sea turtle attempets to reach the ocean is the main inspiration behind this idea. Orginally this game 
would be made in roblox but I think it has potential to become more but is definitly a good place to start, in Roblox
focus on the try to escape the beach into the water you win. However it would be awesome if it was the goal to try and
live as long as possible even facing the great dangers of the depths in the ocean and poachers on hte surface. In
addition to this game more could follow like Natural Selection: Salmon or Natural Selection: Ant Queen (better ideas exist)
